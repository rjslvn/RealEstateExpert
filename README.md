# Simple Theories in Property Forecasting

1. **Properties with More Bedrooms:** Higher number of bedrooms correlates with higher price per square foot, possibly due to perceived luxury.
   - Model: Linear Regression
   - Fields: Number of Bedrooms, Price, Square Footage
   - Methodology: Analyze the relationship using linear regression, evaluating with R-squared and mean squared error.

2. **Proximity to City Center:** Closer distance to city center likely leads to higher price appreciation over time due to convenience and demand.
   - Model: Time Series Analysis
   - Fields: Distance to City Center, Historical Prices, Time Period
   - Methodology: Explore the relationship with time series analysis, assessing using MAPE and RMSE.

3. **Waterfront View Impact:** Waterfront view adds to a property's desirability, potentially increasing its sale price.
   - Model: Decision Tree or Random Forest
   - Fields: Waterfront View, Sale Price, Property Features
   - Methodology: Predict sale prices using these models, evaluating with MAE and R-squared.

4. **Seasonality in Sales:** Seasonal variations, like higher prices in summer, influence property sale prices.
   - Model: Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series
   - Fields: Sale Date, Sale Price
   - Methodology: Decompose time series to analyze seasonal effects.

5. **Neighborhood Income and Price-to-Rent Ratio:** Higher neighborhood median incomes might lead to higher price-to-rent ratios.
   - Model: Linear Regression
   - Fields: Neighborhood Median Household Income, Price-to-Rent Ratio
   - Methodology: Investigate the relationship with linear regression.

6. **Walkability and Market Time:** Better walkability scores could reduce market time for properties.
   - Model: Poisson Regression
   - Fields: Walkability Score, Days on Market
   - Methodology: Model the relationship and evaluate with deviance and goodness-of-fit metrics.

...

Each theory and model presents a unique angle in understanding property market dynamics, illustrating the multifaceted nature of real estate forecasting.
